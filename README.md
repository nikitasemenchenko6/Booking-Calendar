# Svelte Booking Calender

Many customers have asked about the possibility of renting or booking products from the calendar. The project is a simple example of how you can select a day from the calendar and retrieve the free times of that day from an external source.

I would be grateful if the community would like to be involved in the development of the calendar and its features.

The current calendar is a modified version of the [svelte-calendarize](https://svelte.dev/repl/cb4d121decc54cc98e312d5b83c96df7?version=3.26.0).
